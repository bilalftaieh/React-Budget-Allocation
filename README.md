# Budget Allocation App

This project is a part of the IBM Full Stack Development Course. It's a budget allocation application built with React and Redux. This is my first time using Redux for state management in a React application.

## Description

The Budget Allocation App is designed to help users manage their finances effectively. Users can set their budget and add their expenses. The app provides a visual representation of the budget and expenses, making it easier for users to understand their financial situation.

This project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. For state management, the app uses Redux. 

As this is my first time using Redux, this project has been a great learning experience in understanding how Redux works and how it can be used in a React application for state management.
